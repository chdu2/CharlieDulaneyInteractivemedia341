    <p>My Grandma Told Stories or Cautionary Tales</p>
    <p>By: Marlanda Dekine-Sapient Soul</p>
    <p>
      Grandma <br>
      Thelma<br> told<br> me<br> if I slept on my back
      a hag would ride me and I’d never return, so I trained
      my body to sleep on my stomach. Even now,
      if I wake up cold, I open my mouth
      and repeat the 23rd Psalm.</p><p>
      <br>Grandma<br> Thelma<br>told <br>me <br>I might see a plat-eye<br>
      when I was seven years old. I could imagine
      cypress knees growing full bodies
      to walk the hungry road, an entire body
      of eye nicknamed Plat.</p><p>
      <br>Grandma<br>Thelma<br>told<br>me <br>I’d feel welcomed by the eye.<br>
      I’d be made to feel safe and loved,
      but if I looked directly into that big white-bodied cornea,
      I’d forget where I came from.
      <br><br><br><br><br><br>I’d be disappeared.
