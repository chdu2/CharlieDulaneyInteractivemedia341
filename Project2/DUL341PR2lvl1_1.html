    <p>My Grandma Told Stories or Cautionary Tales</p>
    <p>By: Marlanda Dekine-Sapient Soul</p>
    <p>
      Grandma Thelma told me <br>
      if I slept on my back<br>
      a hag would ride me and I’d never return, so I trained<br>
      my body to sleep on my stomach. Even now,<br>
      if I wake up cold, I open my mouth<br>
      and repeat the 23rd Psalm.<br>
      Grandma Thelma told me I might see a plat-eye<br>
      when I was seven years old. I could imagine<br>
      cypress knees growing full bodies<br>
      to walk the hungry road, an entire body<br>
      of eye nicknamed Plat.<br>
      Grandma Thelma told me I’d feel welcomed by the eye.<br>
      I’d be made to feel safe and loved,<br>
      but if I looked directly into that big white-bodied cornea,<br>
      I’d forget where I came from.<br>
      I’d be disappeared.
