    <p>My Grandma Told Stories or Cautionary Tales</p>
    <p>By: Marlanda Dekine-Sapient Soul</p>
    <p>
      <h6>Grandma Thelma told me if I slept on my back</h6>
      <h6>a hag would ride me and I’d never return, so I trained</h6>
      <h6>my body to sleep on my stomach. Even now,</h6>
      <h5>if I wake up cold, I open my mouth</h5>
      <h4>and repeat the 23rd Psalm.</h4>
      <h4>Grandma Thelma told me I might see a plat-eye</h4>
      <h4>when I was seven years old. I could imagine</h4>
      <h4>cypress knees growing full bodies</h4>
      <h4>to walk the hungry road, an entire body</h4>
      <h3>of eye nicknamed Plat.</h3>
      <h2>Grandma Thelma told me I’d feel welcomed by the eye.</h2>
      <h2>I’d be made to feel safe and loved,</h2>
      <h2>but if I looked directly into that big white-bodied cornea,</h2>
      <h2>I’d forget where I came from.</h2>
      <h1>I’d be disappeared.</h1>
