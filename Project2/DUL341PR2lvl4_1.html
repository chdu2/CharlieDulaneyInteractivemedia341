      <span class="Line1">Grandma Thelma told me</span> <br>
      <span class="Line2">if I slept on my back</span><br>
      <span class="Line3">a hag would ride me and I’d never return, so I trained<br></span>
      <span class="Line4"> my body to sleep on my stomach. Even now,<br></span>
      <span class="Line5">if I wake up cold, I open my mouth<br></span>
      <span class="Line6">and repeat the 23rd Psalm.<br></span>
      <span class="Line7">Grandma Thelma told me<br></span>
      <span class="Line8">I might see a plat-eye<br></span>
      <span class="Line9">when I was seven years old. I could imagine<br></span>
      <span class="Line10">cypress knees growing full bodies<br></span>
      <span class="Line11">to walk the hungry road, an entire body<br></span>
      <span class="Line12">of eye nicknamed Plat.<br></span>
      <span class="Line13">Grandma Thelma told me <br></span>
      <span class="Line14">I’d feel welcomed by the eye.<br></span>
      <span class="Line15">I’d be made to feel safe and loved,<br></span>
      <span class="Line16">but if I looked directly into that big white-bodied cornea,<br></span>
      <span class="Line17">I’d forget where I came from.<br></span>
      <span class="Line18">I’d be disappeared.<br></span>
