    <p>My Grandma Told Stories or Cautionary Tales</p>
    <p>By: Marlanda Dekine-Sapient Soul</p>
    <p>
      Grandma Thelma told me if I slept on my back
      a hag would ride me and I’d never return, so I trained
      my body to sleep on my stomach. Even now,
      if I wake up cold, I open my mouth
      and repeat the 23rd Psalm.
      Grandma Thelma told me I might see a plat-eye
      when I was seven years old. I could imagine
      cypress knees growing full bodies
      to walk the hungry road, an entire body
      of eye nicknamed Plat.
      Grandma Thelma told me I’d feel welcomed by the eye.
      I’d be made to feel safe and loved,
      but if I looked directly into that big white-bodied cornea,
      I’d forget where I came from.
      I’d be disappeared.
